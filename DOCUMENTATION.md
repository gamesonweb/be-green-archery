Overview:
Archery Tournament is a browser-based game developed by Chahan Movsessian using BabylonJS. The game is a survival-style archery game where the player takes on the role of an archer and tries to survive four waves of enemies on different maps. The maps are created using Blender and currently only the first map is available. The game also utilizes the cannonJS plugin for the arrow physics.

Gameplay:
The objective of the game is to survive all four waves of enemies by shooting them with arrows. The player has a limited amount of health, and each time an enemy hits them, he loses health. The player can move around the map to avoid enemy attacks and shoot arrows to take down enemies. The first wave starts with a few enemies, and each subsequent wave adds more enemies and stronger types of enemies. The player must survive all four waves to win the game.

Maps:
The maps in Archery Tournament are created using Blender. The first map is currently the only one available, but map 2 and 3 are on their way. The map is small garden with a house and a river, The enemies spawn at random location in the map.


First Map:
The first map is the easiest, the enemies simply moves towards you and you lose health 
if they touch you. However, the last wave may be tricky !


Second Map:
The second map is a colesseum, you are in the center of that colloseum and enemies are 
in the stands, they won't move but they will shoot you. The goal here is to avoid the 
projectiles and survive the four waves. There is also water separating the stands and the center of arena and I really want you to loose if you fall in it

Third Map/ Ambitious Map:
The third map is bigger, it is a ancient-greek village with a hill and a huge temple on it and some other features. This is the combination of the two precedents challenges.
You have to survive four waves of enemies that runs towards while shooting you :D
This is actually the difficult map for me to add because of its size...
But it will be done


Arrow Physics:
The arrow physics in Archery Tournament are handled using the cannonJS plugin. This plugin is used to simulate the physics of the arrow when it is shot from the bow. The physics engine takes into account the arrow's velocity, trajectory, and collision with the environment and enemies.


Conclusion:
Archery Tournament is an entertaining game that provides a fun and challenging experience for players. The use of Blender for map creation and cannonJS for arrow physics adds to the game's realism and makes it more enjoyable to play. Although only one map is currently available, the other ones are almost ready !!
